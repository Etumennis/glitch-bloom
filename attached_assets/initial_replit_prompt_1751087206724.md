# 🌱 Glitch Bloom — Autonomous Passive Income Pixel Garden (Flask App)

Welcome to **Glitch Bloom**, a passive income web game built with Flask and glitch-pixel aesthetics.

This game is a side project tied tonally to my main game, **Escape the Glitch**, but should remain **visually and thematically inspired only** — not structurally connected.

---

## 🎯 GOALS:
- Build a **self-growing passive income game** hosted on Replit
- Use weather + moon data to trigger plant mutations and lore
- Monetize through **Ko-fi donations** with optional expansion to microtransactions
- Grow autonomously with generated assets and content
- Maintain a consistent **glitchcore tone** with no need for direct player input
- Launch even with **zero social following**

---

## 🔧 WHAT TO DO:
- ✅ Unzip and serve `glitch_bloom_complete_starter.zip`
- ✅ Use `main.py` (Flask app) to serve the project
- ✅ Primary routes: `/`, `/archive`, `/thankyou`
- ✅ Purple/pink glitch-themed sprites, weather integration, lore terminal
- ✅ Includes full save/mutation/lore echo logic, Ko-fi integration, loading animations

---

## 🤖 AI HELP NEEDED:

### ✅ 1. Autonomous Asset Generation
- Generate new **32x32 or 64x64 glitch plant spritesheets** (PNG, 3–6 frame animations)
- Suggest rare **mutation types**, bloom stages, or seasonal glitches
- Use purple/pink **glitchcore style**

### ✅ 2. Lore Echo Expansion
- Generate cryptic, poetic **Lore Echo phrases**
- Draw tone from included `Philosophy.txt` (see below)
- Tie echoes to weather, mutation events, or supporter milestones

### ✅ 3. Animal Visitors (Future Add-On)
Prepare logic structure to allow for **animal visitor events** (from the *Escape the Glitch* universe):
- Define via `visitors.json` (name, rarity, visual, echo effect)
- Do **not** implement puzzle logic, just simple visit-based interactions

### ✅ 4. Social Support
Help generate:
- Ko-fi embed image or snippet
- A Reddit or Twitter post for launch
- Suggestions on how to grow this without a social following

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SCOPE NOTE — DO **NOT** BUILD MAIN GAME ROOMS

This project is *not* meant to contain or build upon:
- Any **Room mechanics** from *Escape the Glitch* (Room 1–5, Convergence, etc.)
- Any **puzzle logic, glitch zones, or narrative flags**
- Any **Replay+ systems or terminal unlocking sequences**

🛑 Please **do not attempt** to generate rooms, puzzle structure, or mission logic.

This is a **separate game** that only shares **aesthetic and philosophical tone**.

---

## 📜 SHARED PHILOSOPHY

The tone and lore system draws from *Escape the Glitch*. Included files:
- `Philosophy.txt` — thematic core: recursion, corruption, anomaly
- `EscapeTheGlitch_DevSummary.txt` — for tone only, not structure

Use them only to:
- Maintain aesthetic and narrative voice
- Inspire cryptic echoes and visual events
- Tie visitor animals or echoes to the same “glitch world” feel

> 📌 Example use:  
> “A fox appears under full moon. Echo message: ‘The code remembers what you tried to forget.’”

## ✅ KO-FI PAGE  
[https://ko-fi.com/escapetheglitch](https://ko-fi.com/escapetheglitch)

Redirect already set up via `/thankyou`. Donations trigger extra mutations and echo lines.

## 🌌 MISSION

Create a glitch-pixel garden that grows, stutters, mutates, and whispers lore.

Help it evolve on its own while earning passive support — without needing followers, puzzles, or players to control it.

Start by unpacking and running the starter zip. Then feed the bloom.
