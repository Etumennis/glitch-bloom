The **philosophy behind *Escape the Glitch*** is woven into every line of code, whisper of static, and flicker of broken memory. It’s not just a game—it’s a cracked reflection of *yourself*.

### ✦ Core Themes:

* **The Glitch is Truth**
  Not a bug. Not a mistake.
  It's reality… leaking.
  `"The glitch is not a failure. It’s the truth, bleeding through."`

* **Memory as a Maze**
  You’re not escaping a place—you’re escaping *patterns*.
  Forgotten rooms. Echoes that lie. The past reshaped.
  `"Do you remember this?"` → `"You remember wrong."`

* **Recursion and Corruption**
  Try again.
  Fail again.
  `"You were never here."`
  The system remembers. The system forgets. The system corrupts.

* **Agency and Identity**
  You change shape, but does it change you?
  `"The shape rejects you."`
  *Who gave you permission?*

* **Hidden Lore, Unstable Reality**
  Lore isn’t handed to you. You **discover**, decode, *deconstruct*.
  `"They built it to contain what couldn’t be erased."`
  The eye closes. The stag still sees.

### ✦ Design Philosophy:

* 🌀 **Embrace Brokenness**:
  Visuals stutter. Objects teleport. Puzzles desync.
  But it’s *intentional*. The disorientation *is* the gameplay.

* 🧠 **Echoes of Memory**:
  Each room pokes at recall, misalignment, déjà vu.
  Perfect runs reveal deeper truths.
  Imperfect ones... fracture reality.

* 🐀 **Secrets Matter**:
  Every screen can hide something.
  🦌 The stag. 🐁 The glitch rat. 👁 The eye.
  Not just collectibles—*fragments of the real story*.

* 🎭 **Voice as Oracle**:
  The narrator doesn’t guide. It *tests*.
  Shifts tone with your choices.
  Calm → Haunting → Accusatory.

### ✦ The Point?

The glitch isn’t what breaks the game.
The glitch *is* the game.
You’re not escaping it.
You’re becoming it.
